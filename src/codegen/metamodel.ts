/**
 * The client contract of a bounded context, as sincpro_framework exports it
 * (`export_client_contract`, PRD_33): its metamodel — models, the definitions they share, every
 * operation a client may call — and how each wire reaches each operation (`bindings`). A bare
 * metamodel (`export_metamodel`) is the same without `format` and `bindings`.
 *
 * Context: only what the generator reads is typed here. The file is the server's, written with
 * its keys sorted, so the same code writes the same bytes; a key this does not name is kept in
 * the snapshot and ignored by the generator.
