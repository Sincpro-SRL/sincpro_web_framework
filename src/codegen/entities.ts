/**
 * The entities of a bounded context as TypeScript: one `entity<T, C>()` per model a client can
 * list, its routes and its Commands read off the contract — what a screen used to declare by
 * hand, and what drifted from the server when it did.
 *
 * Context: each route comes from what the operation IS for its entity (`role`), never from its
 * path. A role with more than one operation for an entity takes the one the server marks
 * `own`; with none marked, the generator chooses nothing and says so — a guess here would send a
 * screen to the wrong list. A Command runs on the entity whose record its body names
 * (`targets`): that field is the route's `target`, filled with the record's id when sent, so the
 * screen writes `run(id, { message })` and never the key twice.
