/**
 * A new record's key, minted where the record is born: a UUID v7 as 32 hex characters —
 * sincpro_framework's `new_entity_id`.
 *
 * Context: sincpro_framework's `Edit` creates a new record under the id the CLIENT names («a
 * UUID v7 it mints»), and the draft and the stored record share it from the first draft save.
 * A form that waited for the server to name it could neither keep a draft of a new record nor
 * reach the edit route at all (`PUT /invoices/{id}/edit` needs the id in its path). The layout
 * is the backend's (RFC 9562): 48 bits of unix milliseconds, the version, a 12-bit counter
 * within the millisecond, the variant and 62 random bits — so ids minted here sort by when
 * they were minted, like the server's, and ordering by `id` is still ordering by creation.
 *
 *     newEntityId()   // "019a4c2e7f1074a8b13fa739ccbdcd53"
