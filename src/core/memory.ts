/**
 * A server held in memory: tables of rows with their definition, answered with the same
 * engine sincpro_framework's criteria runs on.
 *
 * Context: not a test double. It is what a screen runs against before its server exists,
 * what Storybook and the tests run against, and what a domain with no server at all uses —
 * rows a screen already holds. It filters, orders, pages and counts
 * exactly as the server would (`answer` from `@sincpro/criteria/engine`), drops what the
 * model cannot answer and reports it, and refuses what the server would refuse. So the day a
 * real server answers, only the transport changes.
 *
 * A record is found at `<list route>/<id>`, by the field the model fetches by (`get_id`, else
 * the identity) — the convention sincpro_framework's REST routes follow.
 *
