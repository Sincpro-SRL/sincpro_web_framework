 * The `Idempotency-Key` of a gesture: one per thing a person meant to do, the SAME one while

 *
 * Context: a Command that got no answer — the network dropped, a proxy answered 502 — may have
 * run. Sending it again with a new key could pay twice; with the same key the server answers
 * what it already did (sincpro_framework's `@idempotency`). So a key lives until the server
 * gives a definite answer: done, or refused for a reason a retry does not change. Changing the
 * body is a different gesture, and gets a new key — the server refuses a key that comes back
 * with another payload.
 *
