 * The model definitions already known, by entity key (`"billing:invoice"`).
 *
 * Context: sincpro_framework sends `entity_meta_data` with every answer that does not say
 * `meta: false`, and it is not small — forge's `Project` weighs ~97 KB even with zero rows.
 * A reading already asks for it only on its first page; this keeps it ACROSS readings, so the
 * second list of the same entity, the record opened from it and the select that points at it
 * ask with `meta: false` and draw their labels before the rows arrive.
 *
 * Seeded, it is the preload: definitions written at build time (a snapshot of the server's,
 * or `defineMeta`) reach the first screen with no request at all.
